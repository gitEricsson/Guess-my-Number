## Overview

### About

"Guess My Number", an simple, entertaining, and interactive JavaScript game, requires players to predict a randomly generated number. Using DOM Manipulation, this project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic and interesting user experiences with varied messages based on the user's input.

### Game Conditions

- A random number from 1 to 20 is generated by the game
- Using the fewest feasible attempts, you should "guess" the randomly generated number
- You lose one point for each "wrong" guess you make
- As long as you continue to play the game, the "High Score" is kept

### The Challenge

My goal was to recreate Jonas' Guess My Number Game from scratch and make some updates to it.

### Features

- Generate random numbers between 1 and 20
- Background turns green on correct guess
- 'Check' button to confirm guess
- 'Restart' button to reset game

### Updates

- Responsive Web Design across all Devices
